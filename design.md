### Design Guidelines

Ahmed wants a modern looking website that would be easy to use by anyone. He likes to keep things clean and simple and loves designs with lots of whitespace.

In terms og color, he really likes the color scheme of his logo so the wevsite should probably mirror that in some shape or form.

He will be developing the website himself and will be making it responsive so we need to make sure our design works well on other screen sizes.
